I am actually working on a podcast generated automatically via AI. 
First I run a python script on local (cursor vscode) which is first creating a file with a summary of ten articles. (genscriptlocal.py attached)
Then I paste this in Chat GPT/POE and ask to create a podcast script out of it. This is because I don't want to subscribe to ani Paid API.
The input prompt is something like this: 
"        can you create a podcast script around these topics for today to caught me up with the world? 
        the podcast is cronisphere and this is the #76 episode. Pls just create the script without titles.
        The output will be inputted in a script that will just generate the voice out of it. {output.txt}"
Then I copy paste the output in this variable on google colab to create an audio out of it. I would do it locally but I don't have any GPU.
From this script I get a video. (notebook.py) I download the mp4 and upload manually on youtube.
Title and description is by chatgpt/poe as well. 

I want to automate all of this without paying any API as I am doing now. I want to be able just to run a button and not doing all these manual steps. Ideas?
